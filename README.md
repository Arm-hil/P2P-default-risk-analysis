# P2P Default Risk Reduction Analysis

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive data-driven investigation into credit default risk within a peer-to-peer (P2P) lending firm. Instead of focusing on profit margins, the primary goal here is to identify the underlying factors contributing to credit default risk. By understanding these factors—such as education level, income, and employment status—the analysis provides actionable insights to help the firm stop lending to borrowers with a high risk of default.

## Motivation

P2P lending platforms face significant challenges when borrowers default on loans, impacting both the platform's financial stability and investor confidence. This project was initiated to:
- Pinpoint the demographic and socioeconomic factors that increase default risk.
- Uncover hidden patterns in borrower behavior that correlate with credit default.
- Develop targeted recommendations to prevent high-risk lending and improve overall portfolio quality.

Using Python and its robust ecosystem of libraries, this analysis aims to empower the firm with data-backed strategies to reduce default risk effectively.
